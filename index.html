        <p>Naruto Uzumaki, an orphaned ninja with a mischievous streak and a dream to become the strongest leader of his village, the Hokage, grew up shunned by his peers for being the vessel of the fearsome Nine-Tails fox spirit. Determined to prove his worth, he trained relentlessly, forging bonds with his team—Sasuke, a brooding prodigy seeking vengeance, and Sakura, a sharp-witted kunoichi.
